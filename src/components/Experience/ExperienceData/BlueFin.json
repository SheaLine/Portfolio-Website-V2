        "I worked at Bluefin Solutions during the summer of 2024, as part of a development team for a web application aimed at Insurance Direct Billing and Settlement. The system was designed to expedite claim settlements, minimize fraud, and maintain regulatory compliance for the Tanzanian market. In my role, I was responsible for designing the user interface and implementing the front-end using React, JavaScript, CSS, and Figma. Additionally, I collaborated with the back-end team to integrate the application's front-end with RESTful APIs and other back-end services, ensuring seamless communication between the user interface and data processing functionalities.",
        "Below are some of the early prototype screens that I implemented."

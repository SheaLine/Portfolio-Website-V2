    "description":[ "I built this project in my Advanced Networks class. The project is designed to simulate real-world enterprise network environments. I implemented key networking protocols and technologies within a campus network architecture. I explored concepts such as VLANs, trunking, Spanning Tree Protocol, EtherChannel, First Hop Redundancy Protocols, Layer 3 Switching, and Open Shortest Path First. By configuring and documenting these technologies, the project not only demonstrates technical proficiency, but also provides a foundation for managing complex network infrastructures in professional settings."

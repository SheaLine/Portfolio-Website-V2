    "description": ["Room For One! is a free-to-play, online multiplayer 3D platformer-racer released on Steam on June 11, 2025. I developed this game as part of a team of 7 as my capstone project. ", 
    "As one of the lead developers, I drove the project end-to-end: designing level layouts, developing the entity system and creating interactive collectable item power ups, and managing the Steam deployment pipeline. I also helped lead regular playtest sessions to gather player feedback and iterate on level design, balance, and mechanics. This launch sharpened my skills in multiplayer networking, performance optimization, and live-ops release management."

    "description":[ "I built this website during my free time to display all of my projects and to tell my story. I wanted to create something that was unique and stand out from other portfolios. That is when I had the idea to create a campfire model in blender to put on the background of the website. I thought that there was no better place to tell a story than around a campfire. Below, you can see the model of the campfire scene that I built using Blender. I used React.js to implement the user interface. The website is hosted on github pages and all the code can be found in the repository linked below."
